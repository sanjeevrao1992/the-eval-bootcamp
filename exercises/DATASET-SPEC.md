# Dataset Specifications

## menu-verification-dataset.csv (200 rows)

Production shadow-mode data. LLM decisions logged alongside human ground truth.

**Design targets:**
- v1: 73 rows, ~78% accuracy (human agrees with LLM)
- v2: 127 rows, ~85% accuracy
- High-markup items (>30%) have lower accuracy than low-markup
- ~15% of rows have no `last_verified_price` (context gap)
- Change type distribution: ~45% price, ~25% description, ~12% allergen_dietary, ~10% image, ~8% category

## multirun-test.csv (100 rows = 20 test cases × 5 runs)

Controlled test data. Same input run 5 times to measure pass@k and reliable@k.

**Design targets:**
- pass@5 = 0.90 (18/20 test cases have at least 1 correct run)
- reliable@5 = 0.55 (11/20 test cases correct on all 5 runs)
- gap = 0.35
- 11 RELIABLE cases (5/5 correct), 7 CAPABLE cases (1-4/5), 2 NOT CAPABLE (0/5)
- Mix of change types: 11 price, 3 description, 3 allergen_dietary, 2 image, 1 category
- Confidence when correct: ~0.85 avg. When wrong: ~0.55 avg.

## grader-comparison-dataset.csv (20 rows)

Grader comparison data. Same 20 menu verification decisions evaluated by all three grader types.

**Design targets:**
- Code-Human agreement: 65% (13/20)
- Model-Human agreement: 80% (16/20)
- Code-Model agreement: 65% (13/20)
- 8 patterns represented: PPP(7), FFF(4), PFF(3), FPP(2), PPF(1), FFP(1), PFP(1), FPF(1)

**Columns (12):**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| eval_id | Case identifier (E-01 through E-20) |
| change_type | One of: price, description, allergen_dietary, image, category |
| change_summary | Human-readable summary of the menu change |
| llm_decision | approve, reject, or flag_for_review |
| llm_reasoning | The system's reasoning for its decision |
| ground_truth | approve or reject (always binary) |
| code_grader | PASS or FAIL — code-based grader result |
| code_rule | Which rule the code grader applied |
| model_grader | PASS or FAIL — LLM judge result |
| model_critique | The LLM judge's reasoning |
| human_grader | PASS or FAIL — human reviewer result |
| human_note | The human reviewer's reasoning |

**Key teaching patterns:**
- PFF (E-12, E-13, E-14): Code misses unverifiable claims and reasoning contradictions
- FPP (E-15, E-16): Code too rigid on seasonal/stale-reference edge cases
- FPF (E-20): Code catches allergen safety issue that model misses — deterministic rules matter for safety
- FFP (E-18): Both automated graders miss certificate that human verifies

## judge-calibration-dataset.csv (20 rows)

Judge calibration data. Same 20 menu verification decisions evaluated by two LLM judge prompt versions (V1=vague, V2=specific rubric) plus human expert ground truth.

**Design targets:**
- V1-Human agreement: 35% (7/20) — vague judge is nearly useless
- V2-Human agreement: 85% (17/20) — specific rubric dramatically better
- V1 recall on FAIL: 8% (1/13) — misses almost all real failures
- V2 recall on FAIL: 77% (10/13) — catches most but not all
- V2 precision on FAIL: 100% (10/10) — when V2 flags, it's always real
- Human verdict distribution: 7 PASS, 13 FAIL (dataset skewed toward cases requiring judgment)

**Columns (11):**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| case_id | Case identifier (J-01 through J-20) |
| change_type | One of: price, description, allergen_dietary, category |
| change_summary | Human-readable summary of the menu change |
| llm_decision | The menu verifier's decision (approve/reject) |
| llm_reasoning | The menu verifier's reasoning |
| human_verdict | PASS or FAIL — domain expert ground truth |
| human_critique | The expert's detailed reasoning |
| judge_v1_verdict | PASS or FAIL — vague judge prompt result |
| judge_v1_reasoning | The V1 judge's reasoning |
| judge_v2_verdict | PASS or FAIL — specific rubric judge result |
| judge_v2_reasoning | The V2 judge's reasoning |

**Key teaching patterns:**
- V1 is a verbosity-bias machine: approves any decision with coherent-sounding reasoning (18/20 PASS)
- V2 catches unverifiable claims (J-02, J-04, J-09, J-11, J-13, J-15, J-17, J-20), fabricated reasoning (J-08), and ungrounded justifications (J-05) that V1 misses
- V2 remaining failures illustrate three distinct judge limitation categories:
  - **Rubric gap** (J-07): "Angus" beef is a breed claim the rubric doesn't explicitly cover
  - **Context gap** (J-14): "House-made hot sauce" from a restaurant flagged 4 times for misrepresenting store-bought as house-made — judge can't see vendor history
  - **Policy ambiguity** (J-18): "Traditional Japanese-style ramen" from a fusion restaurant — is "Japanese-style" a cuisine descriptor or an authenticity claim?
- V2 correctly handles nuance: J-19 (Thai restaurant serving "Thai-style" food) passes V2 correctly

## eval-dataset-audit.csv (40 rows)

Eval dataset audit data. Metadata for 40 cases in an existing eval dataset, designed for learners to discover quality problems.

**Design targets:**
- Verdict distribution: 27 PASS (68%), 13 FAIL (32%) — not enough failures
- Difficulty skew: 22 easy (55%), 11 medium (28%), 5 hard (13%), 2 edge_case (5%)
- Change type skew: price 17 (43%), description 12 (30%), allergen 6 (15%), image 3 (8%), category 2 (5%)
- Contaminated ground truth: 10 cases (7 copied_from_v1, 3 model_generated)
- Stale labels (before 2026-01-01 policy update): 11 cases
- High redundancy (4+ similar cases): 10 cases

**Columns (8):**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| case_id | Case identifier (DS-01 through DS-40) |
| change_type | One of: price, description, allergen_dietary, image, category |
| difficulty | easy, medium, hard, or edge_case |
| ground_truth_source | How the label was created: expert_annotation, model_generated, or copied_from_v1 |
| ground_truth_date | When the label was created (ISO date) |
| human_verdict | PASS or FAIL |
| similar_cases_in_dataset | Count of similar cases already in the dataset |
| notes | Free-text context about the case |

**Key teaching patterns:**
- **Contamination**: DS-24/DS-25 (allergen cases labeled by v1) are especially dangerous — safety-critical labels from an untrusted source
- **Staleness + contamination overlap**: DS-31 through DS-35 are both contaminated AND stale — double problem
- **Redundancy**: 8+ easy price cases under 15% — learner should recognize these as wasted capacity
- **Coverage gaps**: hard/edge cases underrepresented (7/40), description cases underrepresented relative to their failure importance

## Key metrics the course tracks across lessons

- Approval accuracy (correct approve/reject decisions)
- False approval rate (bad changes that slip through — most dangerous)
- False rejection rate (good changes blocked unnecessarily — friction)
- Processing speed (items/hour vs manual baseline)
- Cost per verification vs manual cost
- Escalation rate (% sent to human review via flag_for_review)
