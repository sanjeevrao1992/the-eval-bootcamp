# 🧪 The Eval Bootcamp

A 21-day, one-of-a-kind interactive course that teaches product people how to build and evaluate production-ready AI systems — ✨ by actually doing it ✨

No slides. No videos. You clone this repo, open Claude Code, and it becomes your personal AI evals tutor: teaching one concept at a time, guiding you through exercises with real datasets, and evaluating your product decisions.

---

## 🙋 Who Should Take This Course

This course is for **anyone working on AI products** who wants to build rigorous evaluation skills — without needing a machine learning background.

**Primary audience: Product Managers** shipping AI features and wanting to go beyond gut-feel quality checks. Also great for:

- Associate and Group PMs transitioning into AI-focused roles
- Founders and solo builders who own both product and quality
- Product Leads overseeing AI teams and setting eval strategy
- Technical PMs who want to bridge engineering metrics and product decisions

If you've ever asked *"how do I know if this AI is actually working?"* — this course is for you.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Read any AI system from scratch** — map pipeline stages, trace production logs, identify which stage is breaking
- **Measure reliability, not just accuracy** — pass@k, reliable@k, and the consistency gap that separates demo-ready from production-ready
- **Build a failure taxonomy** — systematic error analysis that turns raw traces into actionable categories
- **Design automated quality checks** — code-based graders, LLM-as-judge, and a layering strategy that scales
- **Build ground truth you can trust** — golden datasets, contamination detection, and lifecycle management
- **Design metrics that drive decisions** — guardrail vs optimization metrics, fairness and subgroup evaluation
- **Run AI experiments** — what's different about A/B testing for LLM systems, and how to avoid the common traps
- **Ship with a framework** — release criteria, production monitoring, and a repeatable ship/hold process
- **Build an eval culture** — how to institutionalize evals across your team

---

## ✨ Course Features

- **Hands-on with real data** — every lesson includes a synthetic dataset you analyze yourself; no toy examples
- **You do the thinking** — Claude computes on request; you direct the analysis and draw the conclusions
- **PM Decision Points** — each lesson ends with you writing a recommendation or artifact; Claude evaluates it against a scoring rubric
- **Adaptive tutoring** — Claude matches your pace; experienced practitioners move fast, newcomers get more examples
- **~30–40 min per day** — designed for working professionals; one focused lesson per day
- **Progress saved locally** — tracked in `progress/progress.json`, gitignored and never leaves your machine

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Already set up? Skip ahead:**
- Have Node.js but not Claude Code? → [Step 2](#step-2----install-claude-code)
- Have Claude Code installed? → [Step 3](#step-3----get-the-course-files)
- Have the files cloned? → [Step 4](#step-4----start-the-course)

---

### Step 1 — Get your terminal and Anthropic account ready

**Open a terminal.** This is where the course runs.
- **Mac:** Search "Terminal" in Spotlight, or press `` Cmd+Space `` and type Terminal
- **Cursor:** Go to View → Terminal, or press `` Ctrl+` `` (Windows) / `` Cmd+` `` (Mac)
- **Windows:** Search "PowerShell" in the Start menu

> ⚠️ **Using Cursor?** Claude Code is a separate tool — Cursor is your editor, Claude Code is what runs the course. Type commands in the terminal (View → Terminal), not Cursor's chat box.

**Create an Anthropic account** (free) at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) if you don't have one — you'll need it to authenticate Claude Code.

---

### Step 2 — Install Claude Code

First, check if you have Node.js:
```bash
node --version
```
If you see a version number, skip straight to installing Claude Code. If not, download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (use the LTS version), then come back here.

Install Claude Code:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Verify it worked:
```bash
claude --version
```
If you see a version number, you're good. ✅

> **Permissions error?** If you're on a managed or corporate laptop, download Node.js directly from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) instead of using npm — this bypasses most IT restrictions. Still stuck? You may need to ask IT to whitelist the install.

---

### Step 3 — Get the course files

```bash
git clone https://github.com/productfoundry101/ai-evals-bootcamp.git
cd ai-evals-bootcamp
```

> **Don't have git?** Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads), then run the commands above.

**If you're using Cursor:** Go to File → Open Folder and select the `ai-evals-bootcamp` folder. Your course files — lessons, datasets, everything — will appear in the left sidebar. These are real files sitting on your computer; you can open the CSVs in Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets anytime.

---

### Step 4 — Start the course

Make sure you're inside the course folder, then run:
```bash
claude
```

You'll see a `>` prompt — that means it worked. Type `go` and your tutor will introduce itself and start Day 1.

---

### 🔄 Returning after your first session

```bash
cd ai-evals-bootcamp
claude
```

Your progress is saved automatically after each lesson. The tutor will pick up exactly where you left off.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `claude: command not found` | Run `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` again, then restart your terminal |
| Permissions error during install | Download Node.js directly from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) instead |
| Blank screen after running `claude` | You're in — just type `go` to start |
| Claude doesn't introduce itself as tutor | Make sure you ran `claude` from inside the `ai-evals-bootcamp` folder, not a parent directory |
| Claude asks to approve file writes | Type `yes` — it needs this to save your progress |
| Stuck mid-lesson | Type `resume` — the tutor will re-read your progress and pick up where you left off |
