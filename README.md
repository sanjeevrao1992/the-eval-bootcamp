# The Eval Bootcamp

A 21-day, hands-on course that teaches product people how to evaluate AI systems — by actually doing it.

No slides. No videos. You clone this repo, open Claude Code, and it becomes your AI evals tutor: teaching one concept at a time, guiding you through exercises with real datasets, and evaluating your product decisions.

---

## Who Should Take This Course

This course is for **anyone working on AI products** who wants to build rigorous evaluation skills — without needing a machine learning background.

**Primary audience (ICP): Product Managers** shipping AI features and wanting to go beyond gut-feel quality checks. Also valuable for:

- Associate and Group PMs transitioning into AI-focused roles
- Founders and solo builders who own both product and quality
- Product Leads overseeing AI teams and setting eval strategy
- Technical PMs who want to bridge engineering metrics and product decisions

If you've asked "how do I know if this AI is actually working?" — this course is for you.

## What You'll Learn

- **Read any AI system from scratch** — map pipeline stages, trace production logs, and identify which stage is responsible when things go wrong
- **Measure reliability, not just accuracy** — pass@k, reliable@k, and the consistency gap that separates demo-ready from production-ready
- **Build a failure taxonomy** — systematic error analysis that turns raw traces into actionable categories
- **Design automated quality checks** — code-based graders, LLM-as-judge, and a layering strategy that scales
- **Build ground truth you can trust** — golden datasets, contamination detection, and lifecycle management
- **Design metrics that drive decisions** — guardrail vs optimization metrics, fairness and subgroup evaluation
- **Run AI experiments** — what's different about A/B testing for LLM systems, and how to avoid the traps
- **Ship with a framework** — release criteria, production monitoring, and a repeatable ship/hold process
- **Build an eval culture** — how to institutionalize evals across your team

## Course Features

- **Hands-on with real data** — every lesson includes a synthetic dataset you analyze yourself; no toy examples
- **You do the thinking** — Claude computes on request; you direct the analysis and draw the conclusions
- **PM Decision Points** — each lesson ends with you writing a recommendation or artifact; Claude evaluates it against a scoring rubric
- **Adaptive tutoring** — Claude matches your pace; experienced practitioners move fast, newcomers get more examples
- **~30–40 min per day** — designed for working professionals; one focused lesson per day
- **Progress saved locally** — tracked in `progress/progress.json`, gitignored and never leaves your machine

## Quick Start

Quick Start
Step 1 — Install Claude Code
Claude Code is a command-line tool that lets you chat with Claude directly in your terminal, with access to your local files. It's what powers the tutor.
Mac / Linux:
bashnpm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

Don't have npm? Install Node.js first (includes npm), then run the command above.

Verify the install worked:
bashclaude --version
You'll be asked to log in with your Anthropic account the first time. If you don't have one, create a free account at claude.ai — Claude Code uses your account for authentication.

Step 2 — Clone and start the course
bashgit clone https://github.com/sanjeevrao1992/the-eval-bootcamp.git
cd the-eval-bootcamp
claude

Don't have git? Install it from git-scm.com, or use GitHub Desktop to clone the repo visually.


Step 3 — What to expect
When Claude starts, it reads CLAUDE.md and introduces itself as your tutor. It will:

Check if you've completed any lessons before
Greet you and recap where you left off (or welcome you fresh)
Suggest your next lesson and ask if you're ready to begin

Your first session will look something like this:
Hi! I'm your AI evals tutor for The Eval Bootcamp.

It looks like you haven't started yet. I'd suggest beginning with
Day 1: "What Does This System Actually Do?" — it lays the foundation
for everything else.

Ready to start? Or would you like an overview of the full course first?
Just type your reply naturally — no commands or special syntax needed.

Resuming after your first session
Next time, just navigate to the folder and run claude again:
bashcd the-eval-bootcamp
claude
Your progress is saved locally in progress/progress.json. Claude will pick up exactly where you left off.

Works with Terminal, Cursor, or Obsidian
Wherever you prefer to work:

Terminal (Mac/Linux): run claude from the repo folder
Cursor: open the repo folder, then open the built-in terminal and run claude
Obsidian: open your terminal, navigate to the repo folder, and run claude
